# Portfolio

This is a simple, yet effective portfolio, built over a few days using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. The purpose of this project was to create a platform to showcase my other projects. As it is serving as my digital portfolio, continuous maintenance and improvements will be made as needed.

The portfolio will be under continuous improvement and maintenance as I work on more projects that need to be showcased and as the technologies evolve. Suggestions and contributions are always welcome.

The design of this portfolio was based on this [Figma Community Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1257703789860932527).

The portfolio was deployed and is [available here!](https://portfolio-arantesjoao.vercel.app)
